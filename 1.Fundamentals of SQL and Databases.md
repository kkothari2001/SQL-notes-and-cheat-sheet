# Fundamentals of Databases and SQL

## What is SQL?
SQL is a language responsible for:
- Storing
- Manupilating
- Retrieving Data

... from databases. Initially named Sequel, renamed to SQL.

It stands for **Structured Query Language**.

Used to gather, handle and transform large amounts of data.
Provides:
- Controlled access
- Data Manipulation methods
- Business Insights


## What is a database 
Database is an organized tool capable of keeping data/info in a way that can retrieved effectively and efficiently.

It stores:
- The actual data
- Metadata (for faster access to the data)

SQL works on **Relational Databases**.

Relational Databases are nothing but a collection of tables, and these tables have some relationship in their data. (More details later)

## Components of a table
### Record
A row of data usually pertaining to a single entity.
### Attributes
A column in a table which contains the same type of values for all the records (entities) in the table.
### Cell
Intersection of records and Attributes; contains a unique, single value.

For eg.
In a table of students, all details about a student will be a record, the column containing the ages of all students will be an attribute, and the age of roll no 1 will be stored in a single cell.
